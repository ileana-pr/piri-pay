## ✨ What FU Pay Me Does

**One profile, one QR code—every way to get paid.** We don’t make people hand out different links for Venmo, Cash App, and each crypto chain. Users set their payment options once; anyone who scans the QR sees **all** of them in one place and pays with whatever they already use.

### Payment options (fiat + crypto in one place)

- 💵 **Fiat (what most people use every day)**
  - Cash App
  - Venmo
  - Zelle

- 🪙 **Crypto (all under the same QR)**
  - Ethereum (ETH & ERC-20 tokens)
  - Base (ETH & tokens on Base)
  - Solana (SOL & SPL tokens)
  - Bitcoin (BTC via QR)

### How it works for payers

- **One scan** → one page with every option the recipient accepts
- **Fiat**: tap and jump into Cash App, Venmo, or Zelle with details pre-filled
- **Crypto**: connect wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect, etc.), choose amount, sign—no copy-pasting addresses
- **Mobile-friendly**: responsive layout, deep links into payment apps, works from any phone camera

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

We use Node.js 18+ and npm or yarn.

### Running the app locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:ileana-pr/tip-me.git

# Navigate to the project
cd tip-me

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Mobile testing

To test on a phone on the same WiFi network:

```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

Then open `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5173` on the device.

**Why we built it:** Combining every payment option into a single QR benefits everyone—vendors and businesses get one link to print or share, and payers (crypto or not) get a simple, familiar flow. Our goal is to make paying and getting paid easier and to onboard as many people as possible, without forcing anyone into one app or one chain.
