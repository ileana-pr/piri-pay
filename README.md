# 🖕😎 FU Pay Me

> **One QR code. All payments.** I built this so you can unify fiat and crypto in a single link—one place for vendors, creators, or anyone getting paid to make life easier for everyone paying them.

## Backstory

This app was built on the fly at Homebase Denver 2026. It was my fourth ETH Denver, and I had a clear goal: find a full-time gig in web3. After three years of studying, grinding, and building, my attitude was different from years past—when I’d been more like begging for opportunity. This time it was (respectfully) *FU Pay Me*.

I brought a handful of 3D-printed Ethereum keychains to sell for $10 USDC to help cover travel. Coordinating payment methods with so many people from different countries and on different chains and apps turned into a real hassle—and that quickly became an idea. I wanted my supporters to pay me quickly and without fuss, especially in a conference where everyone’s busy and on the run.

I was building the prototype so fast I didn’t have time to think of a name. *FU Pay Me* was still the only thing on my mind, so I used it as a temporary placeholder. To my surprise, everyone—including Jesse—loved it. So here we are. I hope you find it a useful little tool, and remember to always say FU Pay Me … followed with a smile.

## ✨ What it does

**One profile, one QR code—every way you get paid.** No more handing out different links for Venmo, Cash App, and each crypto chain. You set your payment options once; anyone who scans your QR sees **all** of them in one place and pays with whatever they already use.

### Payment options (fiat + crypto in one place)

- 💵 **Fiat (what most people use every day)** — Cash App, Venmo, Zelle
- 🪙 **Crypto (all under the same QR)** — Ethereum (ETH & ERC-20), Base, Solana (SOL & SPL), Bitcoin (BTC via QR)

### For the person paying

One scan → one page with every option you accept. Fiat: they tap and land in Cash App, Venmo, or Zelle with details pre-filled. Crypto: they connect their wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect, etc.), choose amount, sign—no copy-pasting addresses. Domain names (like ENS) make addresses friendlier, but you still have to type or spell them; scanning a QR is scan-and-go. Works on mobile, deep links into apps, and scans from any phone camera.

## 🚀 Quick start

You’ll need Node.js 18+ and npm or yarn.

### Run it locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ileana-pr/fu-pay-me.git
cd fu-pay-me
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Test on your phone (same WiFi)

```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

Then open `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5173` on your phone.

The whole point: one QR so you don’t have to choose between fiat and crypto. Vendors get one link to print or share; payers get a simple flow. I’m focused on making paying and getting paid easier and onboarding as many people as possible—without locking anyone into one app or one chain.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind. Ethereum/Base via Wagmi + Viem, Solana via @solana/wallet-adapter, Bitcoin QR generation. Nothing fancy—just stuff that works.

## 📚 Docs

- **[Whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.md)** — The full vision: one QR for all payment methods (fiat + crypto)
- **[How it works](./docs/README.md)** — Quick flow: profile → QR → pay
- **[Mobile testing](./MOBILE_TESTING.md)** — Run it on your phone

## 🎯 Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server (localhost)
npm run dev:mobile   # Dev server (same WiFi, for phone)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview the build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript check
```

## 🌐 Env vars

Drop a `.env` in the project root with your addresses and handles (or leave optional ones blank):

```env
VITE_ETH_ADDRESS=your_ethereum_address
VITE_SOL_ADDRESS=your_solana_address
VITE_BTC_ADDRESS=your_bitcoin_address
VITE_SOLANA_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
VITE_CASHAPP_HANDLE=your_cashapp_handle
VITE_VENMO_HANDLE=your_venmo_handle
